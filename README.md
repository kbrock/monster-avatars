# avatars

Our local development databases do not have user avatar images. But that makes our forum pretty empty. So here is my avatar generator that will generate an avatar for a given id.

Started wanting to use a normal avatar type meme. But I can't draw, so defaulted to something others have drawn. Monsters.

There are a ton of great monster generators out there.

Here is where I got my start
