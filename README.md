# avatars

Our local development databases do not have user avatar images. But that makes our forum pretty empty. So here is my avatar generator that will generate an avatar for a given id.

Started wanting to use a normal avatar type meme. But I can't draw, so defaulted to something others have drawn. Monsters.

There are a ton of great monster generators out there.

Here is where I got my start

  * [http://www.splitbrain.org/projects/monsterid][Origional Monster Id]
  * [http://scott.sherrillmix.com/blog/blogger/wp_monsterid-update-hand-drawn-monsters/][wp_monsterid] (Great images)
  * [http://scott.sherrillmix.com/blog/blogger/wp_identicon/][wp_identicon] - identicons. nice work with color choices
  * [http://blog.gravatar.com/2008/04/22/identicons-monsterids-and-wavatars-oh-my/][gravatar] - summary article
  * [http://blog.dmcleish.id.au/2007/12/20/wavatar-artwork/][wavatar] - newer art work
  * [http://scott.sherrillmix.com/blog/blogger/wp_monsterid-update-hand-drawn-monsters/][newer monsters] - newer art

Using the very pretty wp_monsterid/faces
Not using their algorithm. so may need to tweak in the future
